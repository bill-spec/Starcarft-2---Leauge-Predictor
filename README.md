# Starcarft-2 Leauge-Predictor

This porject was completed as a innocuous, yet fun machine learning project. Starcraft 2 remains one of my favorite games of all time and the ability to work with data as practice was very appealing. 

This project serves two purposes one of traditional statistical infference and one of pure predicitve efficacy. The primary analysis of this project is to see if the actions per minute (APM) of a player are actually signifigant in determining their global rating or if another variable is a cause. Video games developed near the turn of the century were becoming more complex exponentially, Blizzard Studio's 1998 smash hit Starcraft was no exception. Videos can be found online 

The second portion of this porject is purely to maximize the predicitve accuracy of a model.
